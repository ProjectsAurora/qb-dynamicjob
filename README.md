# qb-dynamicjobs

**qb-dynamicjobs** is a versatile script for QBCore that allows server administrators and players to fine-tune and create custom jobs with ease through configuration files. This script eliminates the need for multiple job scripts by providing a single, highly customizable solution.

## Features

- **Fridges and Storage:** Includes three storage optionsâ€”one public and two job-specific storages. While the storage is limited to three, you can add unlimited crafting locations, clock-in points, and tills.
- **Custom Payment System:** Integrates with the business bank account, offering both cash and bank transaction options for a realistic financial structure.
- **Clock-in Systems:** Provides integrated clock-in systems for effective job tracking and role management.
- **Crafting & Recipe System:** Fully configurable crafting system where you can adjust crafting time, required items, and recipes. Supports adding and grading multiple crafting stations by job level.
- **Configurable Targets:** Targets within the job are fully configurable, allowing adaptation to any MLO for any job. Integration with **qb-grocery** for sourcing produce is seamless.
- **Realism:** Adds more realism to gameplay by simulating dynamic job environments and interactions.

## Dependencies

- **qb-target:** Required for target interactions and configuration.
